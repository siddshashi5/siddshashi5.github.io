    <h1>Siddharth Shashi: Project 1 - Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this assignment is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and, using image processing techniques, 
        automatically produce a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, the three color channel images 
        needed to be extracted, placed on top of each other, and aligned so that they form a single RGB color image.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Core Approach</h2>
    <p>
        First, the image is split into three sections of equal height by splicing the image array. Then, using alignment functions, the 
        red and green channels are compared against the blue channel to compute ideal alignment offsets. Finally, the channels are shifted 
        according to their offsets, and then stacked on top of each other to create a single image. One thing to note: large visual 
        artifacts along the borders of images made effective alignment computations challenging, so I compared only the centers of the 
        images to compute offsets.
    </p>

    <h2>Single-scale Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        For images with low resolutions, I implemented a search algorithm that would compute the norm between the two channel image vectors
        at each displacement within [-15, 15], and then return the offset of the displacement that yielded the least norm.

    <h2>Multi-scale Pyramid Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        For high-resolution images, exhaustively searching would be slow and computationally expensive, so I implemented a pyramid search
        optimization. First, images were reduced in resolution until they were less than 500px tall, and then an exhaustive search was
        performed on every offset from [-15, 15]. Next, until the image was back to full resolution, the channels were doubled in resolution
        and then exaustively searched in just the [-2, 2] window, but <em>centered at the previously optimal offset.</em> When run on my
        laptop, this would take at most 30 seconds to finish. 
    </p>

    </div>

    <h2>Edge Detection Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        Though effective, the pyramid alignment didn't work as well as I had wanted because high brightness values between channels made
        pixel intensities insufficient. To solve this, I used a Sobel edge detection filter in both the x and y directions for each channel,
        and then calculated the magnitude of the edges. I then phase correlated the edges between the images to find the optimal shift to 
        align the edges of the channels.

    <h2>Automatic Contrasting</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, I thought it would be interesting to automatically contrast the image by rescaling the pixel intensities. I did this 
        simply by rescaling image intensities such that the darkest pixel is zero on its darkest color channel and the brightest pixel 
        is 1 on its brightest color channel.
