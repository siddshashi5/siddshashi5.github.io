    <h1>Siddharth Shashi: Project 1 - Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this assignment is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and, using image processing techniques, 
        automatically produce a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, the three color channel images 
        needed to be extracted, placed on top of each other, and aligned so that they form a single RGB color image.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Approach</h2>
    <p>
        First, the image is split into three sections of equal height by splicing the image array. Then, using alignment functions, the red
        and green channels are compared against the blue channel to compute ideal alignment offsets. Finally, the channels are shifted according
        to their offsets, and then stacked on top of each other to create a single image. Note: large visual artifacts along the borders of images 
        made effective alignment computations challenging, so I compared only the centers of the images to compute offsets.
    </p>

    <h2>Single-scale Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        For small images, I implemented a search algorithm that would compute the norm between the two channels at each possible
        displacement, and then return the offset of the displacement that yielded the least norm.
